### 1. What is the nature of the gameplay? That is, what challenges will the player face? What actions will the player take to overcome those challenges?

The game is called RhythmRun, it is a rhythm game where players try to match the incoming color line with the corresponding edge on the beat square in time with the visual and music. 

### 2. What is the victory condition for the game? What is the player trying to achieve? 

There is no victory condition per se, but there is a score, the player is trying to achieve a perfect score by matching the beat square perfectly in time with the oncoming colored lines.

### 3. What is the player's interaction model (mouse/keyboard)? 

The player interacts with the game and menu via the arrow keys to control selection and gameplay, the escape button to exit the game, the p key to pause the game, and the enter key to select.

### 4. What is the general structure of the game? What is going on in each mode, and what function does each mode fulfill? 

There will be an easy, medium and hard mode of the game, lower levels are easier on the player with less beats and lower frequency at which the beats come. Medium will have more beats at an increased speed and frequency, and hard will follow this trend in order to challenge the player.

### 5. Does the game have a narrative or story as it goes along? If so, summarize the plot. 

There is no narrative nor story, it is a challenge game.

### 6. Why would anyone want to play this game? What sort of people would be attracted to this game?

It would be a fun rhythm game, people who like rhythm games such as Osu, GuitarHero, DanceDanceRevolution, and DanceRush might enjoy the game.
